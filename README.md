# Sabermetrics and All-Star Selections in Major League Baseball

This project explores the use of sabermetrics, which is the empirical analysis of baseball performance and team strategy, to predict which players are chosen as All-Stars based on the results of their plate appearances. Sabermetrics gained widespread attention in the 1970s and 80s, and nowadays, many Major League Baseball teams use this approach to evaluate player performance and make strategic decisions.

The project is based on large datasets created by the plate appearances within an MLB season, and the main goal is to create a model that predicts future success for individual players. The team initially planned to explore team-level predictions but honed in on the more specific task of predicting All-Star selections based on the available data.

The project is significant because it involves building and fixing models based on statistics that can be tested, compared, and improved. It is feasible because of the way baseball lends itself to statistical analysis and the vast availability of resources for collecting data. The impact of this type of statistical analysis in baseball is potentially significant, with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.

This GitHub repository contains the code and data used in the project, as well as the final report and presentation summarizing the findings. The project was conducted by a team of avid sports fans who were interested in exploring the intersection of sports and data science.

## Project Overview: 

**Background:** Sabermetrics is the empirical analysis of baseball, particularly in the areas of player performance and team strategy. This project explores the use of sabermetrics to predict which players are chosen as All-Stars based on the results of their plate appearances.

**Data:** The project is based on large datasets created by the plate appearances within an MLB season.

**Goal:** The main goal is to create a model that predicts future success for individual players in terms of All-Star selections.

**Approach:** The team used statistical analysis to quantify the effect of various plate appearance outcomes on the success of the team, and built a predictive model based on these outcomes.

**Results:** The team was able to develop a model that predicted All-Star selections with a high degree of accuracy.

**Conclusions:** The project demonstrates the potential for sabermetrics to be used in predicting individual player performance in baseball, and the importance of statistical analysis in sports more broadly.
