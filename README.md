Sabermetrics is the empirical analysis of baseball, particularly in the areas of player performance
and team strategy. Although this practice can be traced back to the early 1900s, the term was coined by
statistician Bill James in the 1980s. Allan Roth's 1913 article, which utilized statistical analysis to
advocate for platooning left-handed and right-handed batters, is the earliest known example. It was not
until the publication of James' "Baseball Abstract" in the 1970s and 80s that sabermetrics gained
widespread attention. Nowadays, many Major League Baseball teams employ sabermetrics to evaluate
player performance and make strategic decisions, leading to significant changes in the way the game is
played. The popular movie "Moneyball" documented this shift towards the use of analytics in baseball.
